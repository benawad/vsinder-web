  <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
  <h6>Last revised on December 5, 2020</h6>
  <p>Welcome to VSinder, operated by Ben Awad.</p>
  <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms of Use Agreement.</h2>
  <p>
    By creating a VSinder account or by using any VSinder service, whether
    through a mobile device, mobile application or computer (collectively, the
    “Service”) you agree to be bound by (i) these Terms of Use, (ii) our
    <a href="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>. If you do not accept and agree
    to be bound by all of the terms of this Agreement (other than the limited
    one-time opt out right for certain members provided for in Section 15), you
    should not use the Service.
  </p>
  <p>
    We may make changes to this Agreement and to the Service from time to time.
    We may do this for a variety of reasons including to reflect changes in or
    requirements of the law, new features, or changes in business practices. The
    most recent version of this Agreement will be posted on the Service under
    Settings and also on govsinder.com, and you should regularly check for the
    most recent version. The most recent version is the version that applies. If
    the changes include material changes that affect your rights or obligations,
    we will notify you in advance of the changes by reasonable means, which
    could include notification through the Service or via email. If you continue
    to use the Service after the changes become effective, then you agree to the
    revised Agreement. You agree that this Agreement shall supersede any prior
    agreements (except as specifically stated herein), and shall govern your
    entire relationship with VSinder, including but not limited to events,
    agreements, and conduct preceding your acceptance of this Agreement.
  </p>
  <h2>2. Eligibility.</h2>
  <p>
    You must be at least 18 years of age to create an account on VSinder and use
    the Service. By creating an account and using the Service, you represent and
    warrant that:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>you can form a binding contract with VSinder,</li>
    <li>
      you are not a person who is barred from using the Service under the laws
      of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction–meaning that you
      do not appear on the U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially
      Designated Nationals or face any other similar prohibition,
    </li>
    <li>
      you will comply with this Agreement and all applicable local, state,
      national and international laws, rules and regulations, and
    </li>
    <li>
      you have never been convicted of or pled no contest to a felony, a sex
      crime, or any crime involving violence, and that you are not required to
      register as a sex offender with any state, federal or local sex offender
      registry.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>3. Your Account.</h2>
  <p>
    You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login
    credentials you use to sign up for VSinder, and you are solely responsible
    for all activities that occur under those credentials.
  </p>
  <h2>4. Modifying the Service and Termination.</h2>
  <p>
    VSinder is always striving to improve the Service and bring you additional
    functionality that you will find engaging and useful. This means we may add
    new product features or enhancements from time to time as well as remove
    some features, and if these actions do not materially affect your rights or
    obligations, we may not provide you with notice before taking them. We may
    even suspend the Service entirely, in which event we will notify you in
    advance unless extenuating circumstances, such as safety or security
    concerns, prevent us from doing so.
  </p>
  <p>
    VSinder may terminate your account at any time without notice if it believes
    that you have violated this Agreement. Upon such termination, you will not
    be entitled to any refund for purchases. After your account is terminated,
    this Agreement will terminate, except that the following provisions will
    still apply to you and VSinder: Section 4, Section 5, and Sections 12
    through 19.
  </p>
  <h2>5. Safety; Your Interactions with Other Members.</h2>
  <p>
    Though VSinder strives to encourage a respectful member experience through
    features like the double opt-in that allows members to communicate only
    after they have both indicated interest in one another,
    <strong
      >it is not responsible for the conduct of any member on or off of the
      Service. You agree to use caution in all interactions with other members,
      particularly if you decide to communicate off the Service or meet in
      person. You agree that you will not provide your financial information
      (for example, your credit card or bank account information), or wire or
      otherwise send money, to other members.</strong
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong
      >YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER MEMBERS. YOU
      UNDERSTAND THAT VSINDER DOES NOT CONDUCT CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS ON ITS
      MEMBERS OR OTHERWISE INQUIRE INTO THE BACKGROUND OF ITS MEMBERS. VSINDER
      MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES AS TO THE CONDUCT OF
      MEMBERS.</strong
    >
    VSINDER RESERVES THE RIGHT TO CONDUCT – AND YOU AUTHORIZE VSINDER TO CONDUCT
    – ANY CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECK OR OTHER SCREENINGS (SUCH AS SEX OFFENDER
    REGISTER SEARCHES) AT ANY TIME USING AVAILABLE PUBLIC RECORDS OBTAINED BY IT
    OR WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF A CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCY, AND YOU AGREE THAT
    ANY INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE MAY BE USED FOR THAT PURPOSE.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Rights you Grant VSinder.</h2>
  <p>
    By creating an account, you grant to VSinder a worldwide, transferable,
    sub-licensable, royalty-free, right and license to host, store, use, copy,
    display, reproduce, adapt, edit, publish, modify and distribute information
    you authorize us to access from Facebook, as well as any information you
    post, upload, display or otherwise make available (collectively, “post”) on
    the Service or transmit to other members (collectively, “Content”).
    VSinder’s license to your Content shall be non-exclusive, except that
    VSinder’s license shall be exclusive with respect to derivative works
    created through use of the Service. For example, VSinder would have an
    exclusive license to screenshots of the Service that include your Content.
    In addition, so that VSinder can prevent the use of your Content outside of
    the Service, you authorize VSinder to act on your behalf with respect to
    infringing uses of your Content taken from the Service by other members or
    third parties. This expressly includes the authority, but not the
    obligation, to send notices pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3) (i.e., DMCA
    Takedown Notices) on your behalf if your Content is taken and used by third
    parties outside of the Service. Our license to your Content is subject to
    your rights under applicable law (for example laws regarding personal data
    protection to the extent any Content contains personal information as
    defined by those laws) and is for the limited purpose of operating,
    developing, providing, and improving the Service and researching and
    developing new ones. You agree that any Content you place or that you
    authorize us to place on the Service may be viewed by other members and may
    be viewed by any person visiting or participating in the Service (such as
    individuals who may receive shared Content from other VSinder members).
  </p>
  <p>
    You understand and agree that we may monitor or review any Content you post
    as part of a Service. We may delete any Content, in whole or in part, that
    in our sole judgment violates this Agreement or may harm the reputation of
    the Service.
  </p>
  <p>
    When communicating with our customer care representatives, you agree to be
    respectful and kind. If we feel that your behavior towards any of our
    customer care representatives or other employees is at any time threatening
    or offensive, we reserve the right to immediately terminate your account.
  </p>
  <p>
    In consideration for VSinder allowing you to use the Service, you agree that
    we, our affiliates, and our third-party partners may place advertising on
    the Service. By submitting suggestions or feedback to VSinder regarding our
    Service, you agree that VSinder may use and share such feedback for any
    purpose without compensating you.
  </p>
  <p>
    You agree that VSinder may access, preserve and disclose your account
    information and Content if required to do so by law or in a good faith
    belief that such access, preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary,
    such as to: (i) comply with legal process; (ii) enforce this Agreement;
    (iii) respond to claims that any Content violates the rights of third
    parties; (iv) respond to your requests for customer service; or (v) protect
    the rights, property or personal safety of the Company or any other person.

    exclusively in the federal or state courts of Dallas County, Texas, U.S.A.
    You and VSinder consent to the exercise of personal jurisdiction of courts
